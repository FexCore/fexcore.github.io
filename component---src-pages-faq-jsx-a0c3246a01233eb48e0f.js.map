Lucky for me, Mistral recognized my ambition and passion towards the world of code and accepted me as one of the candidates. It’s only when Gigi program started that I discovered the the world of algorithms – I was back in the school again! The best one in my life. It provided a complete insight into the full cycle development through practical cases and assignments. I also had an incredible team of people by my side, who now became very dear friends and colleagues. In only 3 months I was confident and ready to create tangible software solutions. If you too join the Gigi School of Coding, you will come to find that there is a whole new universe behind every successful application. In just a few months, you will learn how to create backend and frontend parts of the application in some cool and highly popular frameworks. You will learn what are the best practices for writing a code, what are the best tools to use and how in the world is this application accessible somewhere in the internet?! For me Gigi School of Coding was the first step (and a huge one) to becoming a developer and I still have a whole stairway to pass. The good thing is each step hides so much fun and fulfillment and I love IT!\\n',\r\n    image: 'esmeralda-holjan',\r\n  },\r\n  'denis-salcin': {\r\n    name: 'Denis Salčin',\r\n    position: 'Developer',\r\n    text:\r\n      'Cancelling plans to watch the Champions league in order to attend a recruiting day for Gigi School of Coding bootcamp at Mistral?

Mistral’s bootcamp taught me how to organize time, manage a team and understand the complete process of software development. It is not all just about learning, there are also team buildings, mistral brunches, lunch and learn sessions, games room and more.

Working 8 hours a day in teams on real projects mentored by Gigi, who is the best mentor I’ve ever had, is what the bootcamp was all about. I started to notice improvements on myself as a junior developer soon after, gained working habits, improved my whole personality and learned to respect others’ opinion as well as expressing my own. Gigi uses a really interesting and motivating approach in explaining all the coding rules, best practices and tricks making it easy to learn fast.

That is when all the self doubt kicks in: Do I have what it takes? Is my current skillset sufficient? Will I ever be good enough? I knew one thing though. I was done with all the theory and sleepless nights over a book. I wanted a real project and a real team. Gigi School of Coding offered exactly that. This bootcamp at Mistral is an actual simulation of the real deal. We worked on a project from start to finish, and learned everything you need for web development and more, so you can find where your real strength lies.  My favorite part was all the experience and knowledge sharing. I never thought I could learn so much in a period of 3 months. Mentors did an amazing job showing us how we can make the Web a better place and helping us grow as individuals in every way. During my university studies my main subject was back-end development, but that changed at Gigi School of Coding. I got completely hooked on front-end development in Angular and really enjoyed learning it. The bootcamp covered every bit of the software development process, from the basics like standups meetings (Agile methodology) to UX/UI flows and QA tests! Gaining working habits during the bootcamp was also a big plus for me.

Learning independently is definitely a must no matter what university you attend, but it’s not that easy. Practicing AngularJS, for example, on my own, wasn’t that successful. I knew I needed a mentor, and a team. That is why I applied to Mistral for an bootcamp. Thanks to Gigi’s approach in Gigi School of Coding, I have managed to progress faster than I had ever hoped. What fascinated me the most is the fact that over a 100 engineers at Mistral were open to all of my enquiries. They even asked follow up questions about how helpful was their suggestion or solution and if I understood it fully. I loved their vibe and the whole Mistral community. You can only imagine how happy I was when they hired me after the bootcamp, making me a part of their extraordinary team officially. I have to admit that I worked harder than ever to get that opportunity. The only thing I was sceptical about at the beginning was when I found out that the bootcamp is like 3 months and full-time: “5 days a week, 8 hours of work”.” I asked myself: “Can I manage a full-time bootcamp with my studies obligations?”, “Who can sit 8 hours and code??” - and many other (silly) questions. They were all answered after only one week spent at Gigi School of Coding. With a professional teaching ensemble, relaxed, home- like atmosphere at Mistral, many team buildings, hanging out over in-house gaming sessions, those “long” 3 months were over before I knew it.

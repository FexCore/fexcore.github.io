This led\nme to Faculty of Electrical Engineering where I’ve studied telecommunications - something completely different from what I enjoy and am doing today.\nIt was the last semester of my studies when I’ve discovered my passion for coding through my master thesis. Someone would say that it was already too late to change my path but I would say that it was right on time since not long after that I’ve found out about Mistral’s Gigi School of Coding.\nLucky for me, Mistral recognized my ambition and passion towards the world of code and accepted me as one of the candidates. It’s only when Gigi program started that I discovered the the world of algorithms – I was back in the school again! The best one in my life. It provided a complete insight into the full cycle development through practical cases and assignments. I also had an incredible team of people by my side, who now became very dear friends and colleagues. In only 3 months I was confident and ready to create tangible software solutions.\nIf you too join the Gigi School of Coding, you will come to find that there is a whole new universe behind every successful application. In just a few months, you will learn how to create backend and frontend parts of the application in some cool and highly popular frameworks. You will learn what are the best practices for writing a code, what are the best tools to use and how in the world is this application accessible somewhere in the internet?!\nFor me Gigi School of Coding was the first step (and a huge one) to becoming a developer and I still have a whole stairway to pass. The good thing is each step hides so much fun and fulfillment and I love IT!</p>",frontmatter:{path:"/testimonials/esmeralda-holjan",title:"Esmeralda Holjan",image:"/img/testimonials/esmeralda-holjan.jpg",type:"testimonial",id:"esmeralda-holjan",position:"Developer",name:"Esmeralda Holjan"}}},pathContext:{_PARENT:"SOURCE"}}}});
